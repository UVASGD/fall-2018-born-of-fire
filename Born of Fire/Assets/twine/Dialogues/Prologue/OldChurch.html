The site, barren and empty, awkwardly scars the town square.
Charred wooden panels haphazardly strew the ground,
leftovers of the wreckage.
[[Look around for clues.-&gt;LookAround]]
[[Search underneath the rubble-&gt;Underneath]] 
[[Leave.-&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="LookAround" tags="" position="568.5,185.5" size="100,100">You have no idea what you are looking for, and quickly become confused.
[[Search underneath the rubble-&gt;Underneath]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Underneath" tags="" position="500.5,314.5" size="100,100">You toss a few scraps of wood to the side,
straining a bit for the larger panels and beams.
Underneath a particularly large blackened slab, you find a trap door,
outlined with grey where the ash decided to settle.
[[Open the trapdoor.-&gt;Open]]
[[Leave.-&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Open" tags="" position="521.5,458.5" size="100,100">The door creaks open, revealing a staircase descending into darkness.
If danger ever had a smell, the passageway reeks of it.
[[Go inside.-&gt;GoInside]]
[[Nope the fuck out.-&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="End" tags="" position="154.5,332.5" size="100,100">(EndDialogue:&quot;end&quot;)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="GoInside" tags="" position="329.5,457.5" size="100,100">You step down carefully and come to flat ground after about twenty feet.
Ahead of you is nothing but black, and you have no idea how far
the tunnel stretches out for. You keep a lighter, but you are unsure how much and for how long it will be of use.
[[Ignite your lighter and forge onward.-&gt;Forward]]
[[Nope the fuck out.-&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Forward" tags="" position="208.5,548.5" size="100,100">You press onward and step to the cold stone floor.
The walls are rough and streaked with moss and mold.
You only have enough light to see one step in front of you.
Suddenly, with a puff, your lighter goes out.
Ahead of you, a light shines faintly. You look behind you and
the light from the beginning of the tunnel is nowhere to be seen.
[[Keep going forward.-&gt;KeepGoing]]
[[Nope the fuck out.-&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="KeepGoing" tags="" position="404.5,578.5" size="100,100">As you approach the glow at the end of the tunnel,
you see shapes begin to take form.
A room, adorned in red drapery, walls lined with pots
of strange herbs and plants.
In the center, an ornate marble altar, upon which
rests a simple cloth doll.
[[Pick up the doll.-&gt;PickUp]]
[[Nope the fuck out.-&gt;Escape]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="PickUp" tags="" position="329.5,728.5" size="100,100">You step up slowly to the altar.
The air smells of sage and lemongrass.
Glancing over the doll, you notice it&#39;s yellowed clothes and
tattered texture. It must have been here for quite a while.
You reach out your hand and touch the doll on its head,
and everything
[[fades to white.-&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Escape" tags="" position="479.5,728.5" size="100,100">You turn around and prepare to run.
Whatever you&#39;ve stumbled upon has seriously jarred your nerves.
You bolt down the hall, bouncing off the walls, unable to see anything.
Eventually, you break out into the day.
[[Take a breather.-&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
