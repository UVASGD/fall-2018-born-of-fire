Alexa, play Despacito</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Forest - Clearing" tags="" position="850,476" size="100,100">Entering a clearing laced with a grey haze, patches of char sprinkled with ash, you cough reflexively to purge your lungs of a foul scent. Dead aspens splinter the ground to commemorate the town&#39;s best birthday cake. 
--WIP--</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Knock" tags="" position="150,50" size="100,100">The door opens slightly,
just enough for a pair of beady eyes to glisten out at you.
You prepare to address the person behind the door,
but before you can even part your lips, the door slams shut.
[[Knock again.-&gt;KnockAgain]] 
[[Leave.-&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="KnockAgain" tags="" position="150,175" size="100,100">No response.
It doesn&#39;t seem like the person behind the door
will respond to courtesies.
Maybe you should try a different tactic.

&quot;Go Away.&quot; The voice behind the door, a woman, responds.
Maybe they think you&#39;re an Evangelist.
[[&quot;Do you know anything about the recent fire?&quot;-&gt;Polite]]
[[&quot;Open the damn door before I kick it down myself.&quot;-&gt;Rude]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Polite" tags="" position="25,475" size="100,100">&quot;Yes. It was hot. Now fuck off.&quot;
How rude. This woman has a pretty short temper.
[[Try saying something else.-&gt;Talk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Rude" tags="" position="250,325" size="100,100">As soon as those words leave your mouth, the door flies open,
and you&#39;re greeted with the angry face of a middle-aged woman.
Her eyes are burning with a cold, fiery malice.
[[Steel yourself for a possible fight.-&gt;PrepareFight]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="PrepareFight" tags="" position="450,275" size="100,100">You&#39;re ready to start throwing hands,
when a second head pops into the doorframe.
A man, the striking image of a typical white-collar American,
steps into view and casts you a worried look.
He steps in between you and the woman and smiles sympathetically.
&quot;Forgive us. My wife has had a tiring day, and was just
preparing to get some much needed rest. Isn&#39;t that right, dear?&quot;
The woman, her expression softening slightly, perhaps because
of the presence of her husband, casts you a dark but tired glare
before retreating into her home.

&quot;I apologize for the scare.
We&#39;ve had a rather... troubling time.&quot;
How do you respond?

I&#39;d appreciate it if you didn&#39;t threaten

We left our child at home, you see.
We just needed some time to ourselves.&quot;
